### AI and Warfare: Would You Use AI in Armed Conflict?

In this discussion group, we will be delving into the usage of AI in the military: 
in the current conflicts in Ukraine and Palestine, we have witnessed the
usage of autonomous weapons and machine learning systems for tracking
military targets. This sparks a debate about ethical, technical, and legal 
issues that this usage implies. We will be  discussing it alongside speakers 
from a multidisciplinary background.


**The meeting will take place from 14:00-16:00 in the House of Connections, Grote Markt, Groningen. Coffee and tea will be served :)**

## About the SaAI project

We are a group of PhD students and young researchers at the AI and NLP departments of the University of Groningen. 
Given the fast developments in the world of AI and its increasing impact on society -- such as energy use and environmental consequences of large models, questions about privacy and data ownership, the role of big technology companies, to name just a few things -- we believe it is important to create a conversation about this at the university. SaAI aims to contribute to this by hosting regular discussion meetings and invited talks about a wide range of topics related to the present and future place of AI in society. 


<!-- ## Upcoming meetings
Starting this Autumn, we will organize biweekly open discussion meetings about current topics around AI and its place in society, as well as invited talks that connect to the discussion meetings. Our theme for the first series of meetings is Sustainability & AI. Preliminary schedule (more information about content, and times and locations will follow very soon):

* Session 1: September 15th
* Session 2: September 29th
* Session 3: October 6th
