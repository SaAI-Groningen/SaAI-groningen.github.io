# Welcome to SaAI!

![flyer announcing the first meeting](img/first_meeting_flyer_v2.png)

## Kick-off meeting: September 15th

Our first meeting will be on Friday, September 15th, 15:30-17:30 at the House of Connections (Grote Markt 21, Groningen).

You can register using [this form](https://gossminn.eu/saai/signup_230915.php). _(We have limited space, so please don't forget to register if you want to attend. Also, please let us know if you registered but can't make it, so that someone else can attend.)_

### Abstract

> **Sustainability & AI and AI for sustainability: introduction and perspectives**

> Current discussions on sustainability in the context of Artificial Intelligence (AI) focus mainly on the energy consumption that models, such as neural networks, require to train and deploy: indeed, for large scale models, such as ChatGPT, the training time can amount to even months on clusters of specialized hardwareâ€”which is often also used for the deployment. This same hardware also poses sustainability issues, since its manufacturing requires a large amount of substances whose extraction or production can lead to serious cases of environmental or societal problems.

> Most of the AI community is aware of these problems and there is much active work, both on the hardware and software side, to increase sustainability of their practices. Techniques such as model compression can substantially reduce the memory requirements of the AI models, by trading off little to no performance. However, the effectiveness of these technologies is still up for debate.

> On the other hand, AI can also be used as a helpful tool in decreasing the environmental impact of existing technologies, e.g., by efficiently allocating resources in cyber-physical systems using reinforcement learning paradigms. Examples of machine learning in production are found in the food industry, where models are used to decrease crop irrigation water. Also, AI agents can optimize indoor vegetable and fish growth in greenhouses.

> In this first discussion, we are going to introduce the topic of sustainability and AI from the perspective of AI scientists currently working in the aforementioned fields. We will be introducing the main issues connected to sustainability in the field of AI and, more in general, computing, while presenting, in very broad terms, the technologies involved both in reducing the environmental impact of AI practices, and AI for sustainability.

**Marco Zullich** is a lecturer at the University of Groningen and one of the founders of the SaAI group. He completed his PhD in 2023 at the University of Trieste (Italy), with a thesis on neural network pruning and model compression. His research interests include model compression and trustworthy AI.


## Upcoming meetings
Starting this Autumn, we will organize biweekly open discussion meetings about current topics around AI and its place in society, as well as invited talks that connect to the discussion meetings. Our theme for the first series of meetings is Sustainability & AI. Preliminary schedule (more information about content, and times and locations will follow very soon):

* Session 1: September 15th
* Session 2: September 29th
* Session 3: October 6th
