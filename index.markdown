# Welcome to SaAI!

![flyer announcing the second meeting](img/2nd_meeting_flyer.png)

### **Sign up [here](https://gossminn.eu/saai/signup_231103.php)!**

## 2nd session: November 3rd, 2023

In the upcoming session, we'll take a deeper dive into the environmental costs of LLMs: we know they consume a lot of energy (and water), but how much exactly? And do you measure this, especially with the 'new generation' of models (ChatGPT and friends) that are surrounded by a cloud of secrecy about how they actually work? The session will be led by the SaAI group members with a background in NLP (Natural Language Processing); we'll look at how the debate inside the NLP community about environmental impacts of LLMs has developed in the last few years (looking particarly at [Strubell et al. 2019](https://aclanthology.org/P19-1355/) and [Luccioni &amp; Hernandez-Garcia 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08476)) and contextualize it inside the wider debate about the environmental costs of AI. 

**The meeting will take place from 15:00-17:00 in room 1313.0125 (Collaboratorie A) in the Harmony Building (Oude Kijk in 't Jatstraat 26)**

## About the SaAI project

We are a group of PhD students and young researchers at the AI and NLP departments of the University of Groningen. 
Given the fast developments in the world of AI and its increasing impact on society -- such as energy use and environmental consequences of large models, questions about privacy and data ownership, the role of big technology companies, to name just a few things -- we believe it is important to create a conversation about this at the university. SaAI aims to contribute to this by hosting biweekly discussion meetings and invited talks about a wide range of topics related to the present and future place of AI in society. 


<!-- ## Upcoming meetings
Starting this Autumn, we will organize biweekly open discussion meetings about current topics around AI and its place in society, as well as invited talks that connect to the discussion meetings. Our theme for the first series of meetings is Sustainability & AI. Preliminary schedule (more information about content, and times and locations will follow very soon):

* Session 1: September 15th
* Session 2: September 29th
* Session 3: October 6th
