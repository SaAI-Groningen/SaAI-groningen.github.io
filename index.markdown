### _Are GPT-4 & friends too big? Reflecting on 3 years of “stochastic parrots”_

In this panel discussion event - open and accessible for everyone interested in AI
& Society, no technical background needed - we will discuss the legacy of a
[2021 paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922) which was both influential and controversial (resulting in one of
the authors getting fired from Google!).

The term “stochastic parrot” has since become synonymous with the point of view
that large language models (including the current generation of ChatGPT/GPT-4,
Bard, Claude, LLAMA 2, and others) are inherently problematic: do they really “learn
something”, or do they seem to do so because of the complexity of the
statistical patterns they can recognize and reproduce?

In addition, these models are trained with large amounts of data, and a lot of computational
power is needed both for training and running these models: this causes
unsolvable problems such as environmental pollution (from energy use) and
social biases acquired from sets of training data that are too large to check
and curate the contents of.

The authors of the “stochastic parrots” paper have since become activists
arguing that for these reasons, the use of large language models should be
avoided or at least seriously limited. This stands in contrast to the view
that, while “stochastic parrots” raised important challenges, the benefits of
large language models still outweigh the downsides, and that the paper and its
authors both underestimate the impressiveness of current models and
overestimate their risks.

Now, several years after the publication of “stochastic parrots”, we take a
look at how both large language models themselves and the debates around them
have evolved in the last few years, in which AI and Natural Language Processing
have increasingly become hot topics, in science but also in politics and
society. Our panelists will defend a range of views that are more or less in
favour of “stochastic parrots” arguments, and with a background in different
fields: AI, computational linguistics, and (digital) humanities.

**The panel will take place from 16:00-18:00 in room 5159.0062 (Zernike Campus, Energy Academy)**

## About the SaAI project

We are a group of PhD students and young researchers at the AI and NLP departments of the University of Groningen. 
Given the fast developments in the world of AI and its increasing impact on society -- such as energy use and environmental consequences of large models, questions about privacy and data ownership, the role of big technology companies, to name just a few things -- we believe it is important to create a conversation about this at the university. SaAI aims to contribute to this by hosting regular discussion meetings and invited talks about a wide range of topics related to the present and future place of AI in society. 


<!-- ## Upcoming meetings
Starting this Autumn, we will organize biweekly open discussion meetings about current topics around AI and its place in society, as well as invited talks that connect to the discussion meetings. Our theme for the first series of meetings is Sustainability & AI. Preliminary schedule (more information about content, and times and locations will follow very soon):

* Session 1: September 15th
* Session 2: September 29th
* Session 3: October 6th
