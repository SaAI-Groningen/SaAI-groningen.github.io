# The SaAI project

We are a group of PhD students and young researchers at the AI and NLP departments of the University of Groningen. 
Given the fast developments in the world of AI and its increasing impact on society -- such as energy use and environmental consequences of large models, questions about privacy and data ownership, the role of big technology companies, to name just a few things -- we believe it is important to create a conversation about this at the university. SaAI aims to contribute to this by hosting biweekly discussion meetings and invited talks about a wide range of topics related to the present and future place of AI in society. 

# The organizers

Currently, there are six of us who are organizing the meetings. In alphabetical order:

I'm a PhD student in Computational Linguistics, currently in the last stages of finishing my thesis. I'm interested in using computational methods for studying how our language use reflects our perspectives on societal events, and making visible power inequalities in media reporting on urgent societal issues such as gender-based violence, road danger and migration.
